\section*{\tituloPortadaEngVal}

A declarative debugger for C++ is presented, called DDC. A declarative debugger receives as input an incorrect computation, builds a debugging tree based on the execution of the program and, after asking questions to an oracle (typically the user), points out a fragment of code that is the cause of the failure. We present the debuggerâ€™s main features, such as three different navigation strategies, using test cases as oracles, support for non-terminating programs and a tree transformation.
