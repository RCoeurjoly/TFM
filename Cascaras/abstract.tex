\section*{\tituloPortadaEngVal}

A declarative debugger for C++ is presented. A declarative debugger receives as input an incorrect computation and, after asking questions to an oracle (typically the user), outputs the node\todo{Si no se ha hablado de árbol no se puede hablar de nodo. Decir primero que se construye un árbol.} which is the root cause of the failure. We summarize all the relevant design decisions made, like building the execution tree and asking the user about the correctness of a certain node. We present the debugger’s main features, such as two different strategies to traverse the debugging tree and selection of trusted vs. suspicious statements by means of labels.
