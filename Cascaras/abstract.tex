\chapter*{Abstract}

\section*{\tituloPortadaEngVal}

A declarative debugger for C++ is presented. A declarative debugger receives as input an incorrect computation, builds a debugging tree based on the execution of the program and, after asking questions to an oracle (typically the user), points out a fragment of code that is the cause of the failure. We summarize all the relevant design decisions made, like building the execution tree and asking the user about the correctness of certain subcomputations. We present the debugger’s main features, such as two different strategies to traverse the debugging tree and selection of trusted vs.\ suspicious statements by means of labels.
