\section*{\tituloPortadaEngVal}

A declarative debugger for C++ is presented. A declarative debugger receives as input an incorrect computation and, after asking questions to an oracle (typically the user), outputs the node which is the root cause of the failure. We summarize all the relevant design decisions made, like building the execution tree and asking the user about the correctness of a certain node. We present the debuggerâ€™s main features, such as two different strategies to traverse the debugging tree and selection of trusted vs. suspicious statements by means of labels.
