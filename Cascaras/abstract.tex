\section*{\tituloPortadaEngVal}

A declarative debugger for C++ is presented, called DDC. A declarative debugger receives as input an incorrect computation, builds a debugging tree based on the execution of the program and, after asking questions to an oracle (typically the user), points out a fragment of code that is the cause of the failure. We summarize all the relevant design decisions made, like building the execution tree and asking the user about the correctness of certain subcomputations. We present the debugger’s main features, such as three different navigation strategies, using test cases as oracles, support for non-terminating programs and a tree transformation.
