abstract = {Algorithmic debugging is a technique proposed in 1982 by E. Y. Shapiro in the context of logic programming. This survey shows how the initial ideas have been developed to become a widespread debugging schema fitting many different programming paradigms and with applications out of the program debugging field. We describe the general framework and the main issues related to the implementations in different programming paradigms and discuss several proposed improvements and optimizations. We also review the main algorithmic debugger tools that have been implemented so far and compare their features. From this comparison, we elaborate a summary of desirable characteristics that should be considered when implementing future algorithmic debuggers.},
